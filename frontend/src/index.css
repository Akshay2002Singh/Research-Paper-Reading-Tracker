/* We're keeping tailwind directives just in case utility classes are still useful for layout, 
   even if we don't use shadcn components. 
   If user strictly wants NO tailwind, I should remove it, but they said "use MUI".
   I will keep basic utilities as they are super helpful for margins/flexbox.
   But I will remove the shadcn specific variables from :root to clean up.
